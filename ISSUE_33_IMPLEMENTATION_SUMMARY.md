   - Health status tracking
   - Service metrics collection

3. **Communication Framework**
   - Unix domain sockets
   - TCP/IP networking
   - Message queues
   - Publish-subscribe topics

4. **Configuration System**
   - INI-style configuration files
   - Template generation
   - Validation and defaults
   - Environment management

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Health check framework
   - Performance metrics
   - Event notification system
   - Comprehensive logging

### Integration Points

- **Process Management**: Integrates with IKOS process lifecycle (Issue #24)
- **Authentication System**: Uses IKOS auth framework (Issue #31)
- **IPC Framework**: Extends existing IPC capabilities
- **Device Management**: Supports device driver daemons
- **System Services**: Enables system-wide service management

### Build System Integration
