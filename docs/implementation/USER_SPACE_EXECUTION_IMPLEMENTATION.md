## API Reference

### Core Loading Functions

```c
int32_t load_user_application(const char* path, const char* const* args, const char* const* env);
int32_t load_embedded_application(const char* name, const void* binary_data, size_t size, const char* const* args);
int execute_user_process(process_t* proc);
```

### Built-in Applications

```c
int32_t run_hello_world(void);
int32_t run_simple_shell(void);
int32_t run_system_info(void);
int32_t run_ipc_test(void);
```

### Process Management

```c
int32_t start_init_process(void);
int32_t fork_user_process(void);
int exec_user_process(const char* path, const char* const* args, const char* const* env);
int32_t wait_for_process(int32_t pid, int* status);
```

### File System Integration

```c
int app_loader_init(void);
bool is_executable_file(const char* path);
int get_application_info(const char* path, app_info_t* info);
int list_applications(const char* directory_path, app_info_t* app_list, uint32_t max_apps);
```

## Error Handling

### Error Codes

```c
typedef enum {
    APP_LOAD_SUCCESS = 0,
    APP_LOAD_FILE_NOT_FOUND = -1,
    APP_LOAD_INVALID_ELF = -2,
    APP_LOAD_NO_MEMORY = -3,
    APP_LOAD_PROCESS_CREATION_FAILED = -4,
    APP_LOAD_CONTEXT_SETUP_FAILED = -5
} app_load_result_t;
```

### Error Reporting

```c
const char* app_loader_error_string(app_load_result_t error_code);
void handle_application_crash(process_t* proc, crash_info_t* crash_info);
```

## Integration Points

### Kernel Initialization

The application loader is automatically initialized during kernel startup:

```c
void kernel_init(void) {
    // ... other initialization ...
    
    /* Initialize process management and user-space execution - Issue #17 */
    process_init();
    app_loader_init();
    
    /* Start init process - Issue #17 */
    int32_t init_pid = start_init_process();
    // ... handle result ...
}
```

### Memory Management Integration

The application loader integrates with the VMM (Virtual Memory Manager) for:
- User-space address validation
- Process address space switching
- Memory allocation for process data

### Interrupt System Integration

User-space processes integrate with the interrupt system for:
- System call handling
- Context switching on timer interrupts
- Signal delivery (future enhancement)

## Testing

### Build Testing

Run the comprehensive build test:

```bash
./test_issue_17.sh
```

This test validates:
- Kernel compilation with new components
- Object file generation
- User-space application building
- ELF binary validation

### Runtime Testing

1. **QEMU Testing**
   ```bash
   ./test_qemu.sh
   ```

2. **User-Space Execution Testing**
   ```bash
   ./test_user_space.sh
   ```

3. **Process Management Validation**
   ```bash
   ./validate_process_manager.sh
   ```

## Architecture

### Memory Layout

```
User Space (0x400000 - 0x800000000):
├── Code Segment (0x400000+)
├── Data Segment (after code)
├── Heap (0x600000+)
└── Stack (top of user space, grows down)

Kernel Space (0x800000000+):
├── Application Loader
├── Process Management
└── Virtual Memory Manager
```

### Process Lifecycle

1. **Application Loading**
   - File system access or embedded lookup
   - ELF validation and parsing
   - Memory allocation for process structures

2. **Process Creation**
   - Address space setup
   - Memory mapping for code/data/stack
   - Context initialization

3. **Process Execution**
   - Context switching to user mode
   - System call handling
   - Timer-based preemption

4. **Process Termination**
   - Resource cleanup
   - Memory deallocation
   - Parent notification

## Future Enhancements

   - User-space signal handlers
   - Signal masks and blocking

2. **Advanced IPC**
   - Shared memory segments
   - Message queues

## Known Limitations

1. **File System Dependency**
   - Currently uses placeholder VFS functions
   - Requires complete file system implementation for full functionality

2. **Security Model**
   - Basic permission checking only
   - No user/group security model yet
   - No capability-based security

3. **Performance**
   - No process scheduling optimization
   - Limited memory management optimization
   - No copy-on-write for process forking

4. **Debugging Support**
   - Limited debugging information
   - No debugger integration
   - Basic error reporting only

## Conclusion

The architecture is designed for extensibility and includes comprehensive error handling and debugging support. This implementation successfully completes Issue #17 and enables the next phase of operating system development focusing on advanced process management and system services.
