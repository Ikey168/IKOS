- Focus management and Z-order window layering
- Window decorations (title bar, borders, control buttons)
- Multi-window support with proper event routing

#### 🎛️ **Comprehensive Widget Framework**
- **Button widgets** with press states and click handling
- **Label widgets** for text display and information
- **Text box widgets** with cursor positioning and text editing
- **Checkbox widgets** with checked/unchecked state management
- **List box widgets** with item management and selection
- **Progress bar widgets** with configurable value ranges
- **Panel widgets** for container and layout functionality
- Hierarchical widget tree with parent-child relationships

#### ⚡ **Advanced Event Handling System**
- Mouse event processing (move, click, button states)
- Keyboard event handling (key press/release, character input)
- Window events (close, resize, move, focus changes)
- Event queue management with proper dispatching
- Widget-specific event handlers with user data support
- Event propagation through widget hierarchy

#### 🎨 **High-Performance Graphics Engine**
- Pixel-level drawing operations with clipping support
- Primitive shape rendering (lines, rectangles, circles)
- Text rendering with character and string operations
- Widget rendering with theme-aware appearance
- Double buffering support for smooth screen updates
- Cursor rendering and position management

#### 🖥️ **Desktop Environment**
- Desktop background with wallpaper support
- Taskbar integration with show/hide functionality
- Screen bounds management and coordinate systems
- Multiple window support with proper layering
- Desktop invalidation and selective refresh

### 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

#### **File Structure** (3,300+ lines of code)

└── gui_test.c               # Test suite & demos (400+ lines)
```

#### **Integration Points**
- **Framebuffer Driver (Issue #26)** - Direct hardware graphics integration
- **Memory Management** - Kernel kmalloc/kfree integration
- **Input System** - Keyboard and mouse event processing
- **Build System** - Complete Makefile integration

#### **Memory Management**
- Static allocation pools for predictable memory usage
- Widget/window slot-based management
- Proper cleanup on destruction to prevent leaks
- Memory bounds checking for security

#### **Performance Optimizations**
- Dirty rectangle tracking for efficient redraws
- Clipping support to minimize rendering work
- Event queue management to prevent overflow
- Modular rendering with selective updates

### 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

#### **Test Suite Included**
- **Basic functionality tests** - Window and widget creation
- **Event handling tests** - Mouse and keyboard input validation
- **Rendering tests** - Graphics operations and widget display
- **Performance tests** - Stress testing with many widgets/windows
- **Integration tests** - Framebuffer and input system interaction

#### **Demo Applications**
