## Integration with Device Manager

The USB controller integrates seamlessly with the existing Device Driver Framework:

### Device Registration
```c
// USB devices automatically register with device manager
device_t* ikos_device = device_create(DEVICE_CLASS_INPUT, device_type, "usb_device");
ikos_device->vendor_id = usb_device->device_desc.idVendor;
ikos_device->product_id = usb_device->device_desc.idProduct;
device_register(ikos_device);
```

### Resource Management
- Uses existing device resource allocation
- Integrates with PCI bus enumeration
- Shares IRQ and memory management

### Device State Management
- Follows device manager state model
- Supports hot-plug/unplug events
- Maintains device lifecycle consistency

## Key Features

- Per-controller device management

### 2. Device Enumeration
- Automatic detection of connected devices
- Standard USB enumeration procedure
- Device descriptor parsing and validation

### 3. Transfer Operations
- Control transfers for device configuration
- Bulk transfers for mass storage
- Interrupt transfers for HID devices
- Isochronous transfers (framework ready)

### 4. Hot-Plug Support
- Dynamic device connection/disconnection
- Automatic driver binding
- Resource cleanup on removal

### 5. Statistics and Monitoring
```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t controllers_found;
    uint32_t devices_connected;
    uint32_t transfers_completed;
    uint32_t transfers_failed;
    uint32_t hid_devices;
    uint32_t storage_devices;
    uint32_t errors;
} usb_stats_t;
```

## API Usage Examples

### Controller Initialization
```c
// Initialize USB subsystem
usb_controller_init();

// Register USB controller from PCI device
device_t* pci_device = /* PCI enumeration result */;
usb_register_controller(pci_device);

// Start controller
usb_controller_t* controller = usb_get_controllers();
usb_controller_start(controller);
```

### Device Management
```c
// Enumerate connected devices
usb_enumerate_devices(controller);

// Get connected devices
usb_device_t* device = usb_get_devices();

// Perform control transfer
usb_control_transfer(device, USB_DIR_IN | USB_TYPE_STANDARD, 
                    USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR, 0x0100, 0, 
                    buffer, sizeof(buffer));
```

### Device Class Operations
```c
// Initialize HID support
usb_hid_init();

// Register HID device
if (device->device_desc.bDeviceClass == USB_CLASS_HID) {
    usb_hid_register_device(device);
}

// Initialize mass storage support
usb_storage_init();
usb_storage_register_device(storage_device);
```
