# IKOS Issue #37: GUI (Graphical User Interface) System Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of a graphical user interface system for IKOS operating system, building on the existing framebuffer driver (Issue #26) and terminal emulator (Issue #34). This GUI system provides window management, event handling, and a complete desktop environment.

## Features Implemented

### üñ•Ô∏è **Window Manager**
- **Window Creation & Management**: Create, resize, move, minimize, maximize windows
- **Window Decorations**: Title bars, borders, control buttons (minimize, maximize, close)
- **Z-Order Management**: Window layering and focus control
- **Desktop Environment**: Taskbar, desktop background, system tray

### üé® **Widget System**
- **Basic Widgets**: Buttons, labels, text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons
- **Container Widgets**: Panels, frames, tab containers
- **Advanced Widgets**: Menus, toolbars, status bars, progress bars
- **Custom Widget Support**: Framework for creating custom widgets

### üéØ **Event System**
- **Mouse Events**: Click, double-click, hover, drag-and-drop
- **Keyboard Events**: Key press, key release, text input
- **Window Events**: Resize, move, focus change, close
- **System Events**: Timer events, paint events, system notifications

### üé™ **Graphics System**
- **2D Graphics**: Lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, gradients
- **Text Rendering**: Multiple fonts, text formatting, alignment
- **Image Support**: Bitmap display, image scaling, transparency
- **Drawing Context**: Clipping, transformations, coordinate systems

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Window Manager (`gui_window_manager.c`)
- **Window Registration**: Track all active windows
- **Layout Management**: Arrange windows on desktop
- **Input Dispatch**: Route input events to appropriate windows
- **Resource Management**: Handle window memory and cleanup

#### 2. Widget Framework (`gui_widgets.c`)
- **Widget Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships
- **Event Propagation**: Bubble events through widget tree
- **Layout Engines**: Automatic widget positioning and sizing
- **Property System**: Configurable widget properties

#### 3. Graphics Engine (`gui_graphics.c`)
- **Drawing Primitives**: Basic shape and text drawing
- **Clipping System**: Restrict drawing to valid regions
- **Double Buffering**: Smooth animation and flicker-free updates
- **Color Management**: Palette and RGB color support

#### 4. Event Manager (`gui_events.c`)
- **Input Processing**: Convert hardware events to GUI events
- **Event Queue**: Asynchronous event handling
- **Event Filters**: Pre-process and modify events
- **Callback System**: Register and invoke event handlers

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Features
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal redraw with dirty region tracking
- **Memory Management**: Optimized widget and window memory usage
- **Fast Event Processing**: Low-latency input response
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple applications

### Integration Points
- **Framebuffer Driver**: Uses Issue #26 framebuffer for display output
- **Terminal Emulator**: Integrates with Issue #34 for text applications
- **Process Manager**: Coordinates with process system for multi-app support
- **File System**: Loads resources, fonts, and application data

### System Requirements
- **Memory**: 2MB minimum for GUI subsystem
- **Graphics**: Framebuffer driver with 16-bit color minimum
- **Input**: Keyboard and mouse driver support
- **Storage**: 5MB for GUI resources and fonts
