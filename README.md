# IKOS
A modular microkernel-based operating system built from scratch in C++, designed for x86 and x86_64 architectures. IKOS follows a fully modular architecture, enabling independent development of features, high security, and scalability. Initially bootstrapped with GRUB, IKOS will later incorporate a custom bootloader.
