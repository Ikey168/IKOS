# IKOS Interrupt Handling Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive interrupt handling system for the IKOS kernel as specified in Issue #13. The implementation provides essential hardware interrupt support and establishes the foundation for advanced kernel features.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
- **File**: `include/idt.h`, `kernel/idt.c`
- **Purpose**: Sets up the IDT with 256 entries for all interrupt types
- **Features**:
  - CPU exception handlers (divide by zero, page fault, general protection fault, etc.)
  - Hardware IRQ handlers (timer, keyboard, and other devices)
  - System call interface (interrupt 128)
  - PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) management

### 2. Assembly Interrupt Stubs
- **File**: `kernel/interrupt_stubs.asm`
- **Purpose**: Low-level interrupt entry points and register management
- **Features**:
  - Saves and restores all CPU registers
  - Handles interrupts with and without error codes
  - Provides common entry points for exceptions, IRQs, and system calls
  - Implements proper segment setup for kernel mode

### 3. High-Level Interrupt Handlers
- **File**: `kernel/interrupt_handlers.c`
- **Purpose**: C-based interrupt processing and dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Exception handling with detailed error reporting
  - Timer interrupt handling for scheduling support
  - Keyboard interrupt handling with input buffering
  - Interrupt statistics and debugging
  - Page fault handling framework

### 4. Kernel Main Loop
- **File**: `kernel/kernel_main.c`
- **Purpose**: Main kernel execution with interrupt-driven functionality
- **Features**:
  - Initializes all kernel subsystems
  - Interrupt-driven keyboard input processing
  - Timer-based system monitoring
  - Simple command interface for testing
  - System reboot functionality

### 5. PIC Management
- **Integrated in**: `kernel/idt.c`
- **Purpose**: Manages the Programmable Interrupt Controller
- **Features**:
  - PIC initialization and remapping
  - IRQ masking and unmasking
  - End of Interrupt (EOI) signaling
  - Support for cascaded PIC configuration

## Key Features

### Exception Handling
- **Divide by Zero**: Graceful handling with system information
- **Page Fault**: Detailed fault analysis with address and error code
- **General Protection Fault**: Segment selector analysis and debugging
- **Double Fault**: Critical error handling with system halt

### Hardware Interrupt Support
- **Timer (IRQ 0)**: 100Hz timer for scheduling and system timing
- **Keyboard (IRQ 1)**: Input processing with ASCII conversion
- **Extensible**: Framework for adding additional hardware interrupts

### System Call Interface
- **Interrupt 128**: Dedicated system call entry point
- **Register-based**: Parameters passed through CPU registers
- **Extensible**: Framework for implementing system call table

### Debugging and Monitoring
- **Interrupt Statistics**: Counters for all interrupt types
- **Debug Output**: Detailed exception and error reporting
- **System Information**: Timer uptime and interrupt counts

## Integration

### Memory Management
- Works with existing VMM (Virtual Memory Manager)
- Proper page fault handling framework
- Memory allocation support for interrupt buffers

### Scheduler Support
- Timer interrupt provides scheduling tick
- Task switching hooks prepared for scheduler integration
- Context switching framework ready

### User Space Interface
- System call mechanism for user-kernel communication
- Keyboard input for user applications
- Foundation for process management

## Build Integration

### Makefile Updates
- Added interrupt-specific build targets
- Integrated with existing kernel build system
- Support for interrupt testing and debugging

### Test Framework
- Created interrupt handling tests
- Smoke test capability
- Function validation and structure verification

## Usage

### Compilation
```bash
make interrupts          # Build interrupt components
make interrupt-smoke     # Run basic tests
```

### Integration with Kernel
The interrupt system is automatically initialized when the kernel starts:
1. IDT setup with all handlers
2. PIC initialization and configuration
3. Enable essential interrupts (timer, keyboard)
4. Start main kernel loop

### Debugging
- Press 'h' for help menu
- Press 's' for interrupt statistics
- Press 't' for timer information
- Press 'r' to reboot system

## Future Enhancements

### Scheduler Integration
- Timer-based preemptive scheduling
- Task switching on timer interrupts
- Priority-based scheduling support

### Advanced Exception Handling
- Page fault resolution with demand paging
- Copy-on-write page fault handling
- Swapping and memory management

### Extended Hardware Support
- Network interface interrupts
- Storage device interrupts
- Audio and graphics hardware support

### System Call Expansion
- Complete system call table
- File system operations
- Process management calls
- Inter-process communication

## Status
✅ **Complete**: Basic interrupt handling infrastructure
✅ **Complete**: CPU exception handling
✅ **Complete**: Timer and keyboard interrupt support
✅ **Complete**: PIC management and IRQ handling
✅ **Complete**: System call framework
✅ **Complete**: Integration with kernel build system

The interrupt handling system is now ready for integration with advanced kernel features like scheduling, process management, and user-space applications.
